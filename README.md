# DeepLearning_ND_2020

This repository contains my solutions for the projects I created during the Udacity Nanodegree course: Deep Learning. I participated in the course in Q2/2020.<br>

Projects:
    Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
        In this project, I built and train a Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

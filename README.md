# DeepLearning_ND_2020

This repository contains my solutions for the projects I created during the Udacity Nanodegree course: Deep Learning. <br>
I participated in the course between Q2/2020 and Q3/2020.<br>

Projects: <br>
2. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
- In this project, I built and train a Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. 

3. Dog-Breed Classifier

- In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.

4. Generate TV Scripts

- Generate a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network.

5. Generate Faces

- Define two adversarial networks, a generator and discriminator, and train them until you can generate realistic faces.

6. Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model

- In this project, you will build and deploy a neural network which predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review. In addition, you will create a simple web app that uses your deployed model.
